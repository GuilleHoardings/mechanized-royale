Create a top-down battlefield texture for a tank strategy game with these specifications:
Technical Requirements:
- Dimensions: 576×1408 pixels (18×44 tiles at 32px each)
- Vertical orientation (taller than wide)
- Tileable edges for potential expansion
- High contrast for tank visibility
- The tiles have to be visible so that the user knows in which tile he is deploying units.
Battlefield Layout:
- Top section (rows 0-20): Enemy deployment zone with defensive positions
- Middle section (rows 21-22): Horizontal river running across the battlefield
- Bottom section (rows 23-43): Player deployment zone
River location: Horizontal river running across rows 16-17 (middle section of battlefield)
Bridge crossings: Two separate bridges crossing the river
- Left bridge: Located at columns 2-4, spanning 3 tiles wide, aligned with left tower positions
- Right bridge: Located at columns 12-14, spanning 3 tiles wide, aligned with right tower positions
- Bridge gap: Open water section between the two bridges (columns 5-11) with no crossing points
Terrain Features:
- Base terrain: Mixed grass and dirt 
- River: Dark blue-gray water with subtle flow patterns, not too reflective
- Bridges: Concrete or metal bridge segments
Visual Style:
- Inspired by WWII European theater in the style of Clash Royale
- Muted color palette: Greens, browns, grays with battlefield wear
- Top-down perspective optimized for tank visibility
- No large obstacles that would block tank movement paths
- Clear visual distinction between zones without harsh borders
Lighting and Details:
- Consistent top-down lighting casting subtle shadows
- Texture variety to avoid repetitive patterns
Generate this as a seamless battlefield texture. Don't use any text in the image.
