3. **Information Display**: Shows AI energy level and tank count
4. **Mode Transitions**: Visual feedback when AI changes strategy

## 🎮 AI Strategy Modes Explained

### 🔴 Aggressive Mode
**Triggers:**
- Player base health below 40%
- Battle time under 60 seconds
- AI has energy advantage

**Behavior:**
- Deploys tanks every 2-4 seconds
- Prefers Light and Medium tanks for speed
- Positions units closer to player base
- Rushes with multiple cheap units

### 🔵 Defensive Mode  
**Triggers:**
- AI base health below 30%
- Outnumbered by player tanks
- Energy disadvantage

**Behavior:**
- Deploys tanks every 4-6 seconds
- Prefers Heavy and Medium tanks for durability
- Positions units closer to AI base
- Focuses on base protection

### 🟠 Balanced Mode
**Triggers:**
- Even battlefield conditions
- Early to mid-game
- Similar tank counts

**Behavior:**
- Deploys tanks every 3-5 seconds
- Prefers Medium tanks for versatility
- Uses central positioning
- Maintains tank parity with player

## 🎯 Smart AI Features

### Counter-Play Intelligence
- **Heavy Tank Counter**: Deploys Medium/Heavy tanks against player Heavy tanks
- **Rush Defense**: Deploys defensive units when detecting player rush
- **Energy Matching**: Maintains similar deployment rate to player
- **Type Variety**: Uses diverse tank mix to handle different situations

### Strategic Positioning
- **Aggressive**: Deploys closer to player base for faster attacks
- **Defensive**: Deploys closer to AI base for protection
- **Flanking**: Uses randomized positioning to avoid predictable patterns
- **Zone Control**: Maintains presence across deployment area

### Dynamic Difficulty
- **Reactive Challenge**: Harder to beat when you're winning
- **Comeback Mechanics**: AI becomes more aggressive when behind
- **Time Pressure**: Final minute creates intense AI aggression
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI adjusts to your playstyle within the match

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### AI Strategy Indicator
- **Location**: Top-left corner below timer
- **Information**: "AI: AGGRESSIVE | Energy: HIGH | Tanks: 3"
- **Color Coding**: Red = Aggressive, Blue = Defensive, Orange = Balanced
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes as AI strategy adapts

### Enhanced Feedback
- **Strategy Transitions**: See AI change tactics in real-time
- **Threat Recognition**: AI indicator shows when it detects threats
- **Energy Status**: Know when AI is saving up for big deployments
- **Tank Counting**: Track AI army size vs your own

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### For Players
- **Counter-Strategy**: Need to adapt tactics as AI changes behavior
- **Timing Matters**: AI responds faster to deployments now
- **Resource Management**: AI punishes poor energy management
- **Positioning**: AI uses smarter deployment locations

### Tactical Depth
